		<h3>Welcome to My Website</h3>
		<article class = "widthintro">
			<p>Hello my name is Thomas Ghidey and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am majoring in economics and getting my certificate in data science. I will be graduating in Spring 2025 with a Bachelors of Science degree from the<a href="https://ls.wisc.edu/"> College of Letters and Science</a> and am currently looking to work with data in some capacity after graduation. I was born and raised in Minnesota and have been living in the Midwest my whole life. Growing up, I was apart of many different extracurricular activities that were often apart of my education. I tried multiple sports but I was primarily invested in playing basketball which I gained interest in when I was in middle school. Nowadays I mainly exercise in the form of cardio and weightlifting. I grew up being involved with music and I have had the privilege of traveling to different places around the world.</p>
