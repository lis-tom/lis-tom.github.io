			<p>Hello my name is Thomas Ghidey and welcome to my website. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and I am majoring in Economics and getting my certificate in Data Science. I will be graduating in Spring 2025 with a Bachelors of Science degree from the<a href="https://ls.wisc.edu/"> College of Letters and Science</a> and am currentely looking to work with data in some capacity after graduation, with more specifically looking to work in a data analytical field. I was born and raised in Minnesota and have been living in the Midwest my whole life. Growing up, I was apart of many different extracurricular activities that were often apart of my education. I played sports like soccer and track but I was primarily invested in playing basketball which I gained interest in when I was in middle school. I still enjoy the sport and I play it from time to time. Nowadays I mainly exercise in the form of cardio and weightlifting. I grew up being involved with music and I have had the priveldge of traveling to different places around the world.  </p>
