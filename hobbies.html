		<h3>Basketball</h3>
		<p>I started playing basketball around middle school age. I was inspired by many basketball stars like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Lebron James to name a few players. I played basketball in middle school and highschool, but I no longer am playing organized basketball. Although this is the case, I still enjoy the game of basketball and I am grateful for all of the fun I had while playing the sport. I still play it from time to time. </p>

		<h3>Exercise</h3>
		<p>College was when I started to get interested in exercising. I started getting into weightlifting and this is primarily how I exercise. I also have been enjoying cardio and I have been getting more into it in recent years. The weightlifting facilities at UW-Madison are great and that is where I exercise when I am on campus. I have primarily gone to the Bakke Recreational Center and I used to go to the Shell before it was shut down.</p>
