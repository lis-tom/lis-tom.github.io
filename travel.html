		<h3>Places I have Been</h3>
		<dl class ="edit-description">

			<dt> Washington, USA</dt>
			<dd>- Visited Seattle and had a great time. Have been multiple times in the past and have seen the space needle. I loved being able to visit Mt. Rainier and generally seeing how vibrant the nature is even in the city. The food was also great. </dd>


			<dt> Sweden </dt>
			<dd>- I have also been here multiple times and I found Europe unique compared to my experience in the United States. I spent time in Stockholm and I thought it was a great experience. I traversed throughout the old town and even went to the Gr√∂na Lund amusement park. </dd>

			<dt> England </dt>
			<dd>- Traveled to London and enjoyed it. I thought the architecture and history of the city was interesting. I had the opportunity to learn about the city through the bus tour that I took there and I saw historical places like Buckingham palace. </dd>
